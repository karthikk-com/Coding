# Two Sum Array Problem

> Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Verify the constraints

1. How many solution can each input can have ?
2. Is all the numbers in the input are positive or can there be negative ?
3. Are there any duplicate numbers in the array ?
4. Will there always be a solution available ?
5. what to return if there is no solution ?

## Test Cases

`Input : [1,3,7,9,2] , Target : 11 , Solution(Returning the index) : [3,4]`

`Input : [1,3,7,9,2] , Target : 25 , Solution : null`

`Input : [] , Target : 11 , Solution : null`

`Input : [5] , Target : 11 , Solution : null` ==-> We need two numbers==

`Input : [1,6] , Target : 7 , Solution : [0,1]`
