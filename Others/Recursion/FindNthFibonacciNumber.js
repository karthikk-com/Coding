Find the nth fibonacci Number .

Fibonacci Number : In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
Index  : 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7,  8 , 9, 10, 11,  12..
Series : 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144..

Numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence are known as Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n)â€Š. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1
F{n}=F{n-1}+F{n-2} for n > 1
