# Patterns

> Nested loops
```
1. Outer Loop - Specifically for the rows
2. Inner Loop - Specifically for the columns 
```


> **Rules to solve**
* For the outer loop - count the number of lines ( rows )
* For the innter loop - Focus on the problems and connect them somehow to the rows
* Whatever you want to print, Print inside the inner loop
* Observe symmetry in case of some patterns ( Optional )
