# Patterns

> Nested loops
>> Outer Loop - Specifically for the rows
>> Inner Loop - Specifically for the columns 


### Rules to solve
* For the outer loop - count the number of lines ( rows )
* For the innter loop - Focus on the problems and connect them somehow to the rows
* Whatever you want to print, Print inside the inner loop
* Observe symmetry in case of some patterns ( Optional )
